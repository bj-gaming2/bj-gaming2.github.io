				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are certain topics that even some of the smartest people I talk with who aren’t startup oriented can’t fully grok. One of them is whether profitability matters. It’s common cocktail party chatter to hear people confidently pronounce that some well known startup is sure to blow up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101 size-full" src="https://mylisting.27collective.net/my-city/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/07/2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1285" srcset="https://mylisting.27collective.net/my-city/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/07/2.jpg 1920w, https://mylisting.27collective.net/my-city/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/07/2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://mylisting.27collective.net/my-city/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/07/2-768x514.jpg 768w, https://mylisting.27collective.net/my-city/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/07/2-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you know the other one — the one where Snapchat lost $2 billion in just one quarter. Two-fucking-billion! What a disaster! Except that they didn’t actually lose $2 billion in cash. It was a stock option incentive related “expense” but I bet you didn’t know that because in an era where we only read the headlines — they must be a train wreck losing billions. (They actually lost about $175 million in cash in that quarter, FWIW. See appendix if you want to know more on this.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“How could they succeed when they’re not even profitable!”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you hire 6 senior sales reps in January at $120,000 / year salary then you’ve taken on an extra $60,000 per month in costs yet these sales people might not close new business for 6 months. Your profitability will go down for 2 quarters while your growth may increase dramatically in quarters 3–12.<br />
I know this seems obvious but I promise you that even smart people forget this when talking about profitability. 70–80% of the costs of most startups are employee costs so what you’re really talking about when a company is unprofitable is that they are growing their staff ahead of their revenue.</p>

<p>Since most enterprise applications contain sensitive data pertaining to the company, there are very few examples out there that talk to some of the common problems faced while designing enterprise apps. There exists pattern libraries that talk in-depth about how each component should work but very little on when to use them. The patterns we see in design libraries are often oversimplified and does not work in real enterprise applications where data and the use-cases are more complex in nature.</p>
<p>What you see below is a typical enterprise application. The working window is dense with information with a crazy number of panels each indicating information that is contextual to any other selection made on the screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember when you first met Spider-Man? Maybe it was in an animated series. Or maybe you saw Tobey Maguire in that iconic red-and-blue suit. Or maybe while you were flipping through the pages of a Todd McFarlane–drawn comic. However you first came across your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, the Marvel superhero has been such a persistent part of our pop culture since his arrival in 1962 that he’s practically Americana.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One day when I was biking home from school in suburban California, I went by this 7-Eleven,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Spider-Man has long been one of the most popular characters in fiction, let alone comic books, and unlike some of his confederates, he’s a hit across demographics. Whether comic book lifers or children dressing up as him for Halloween, there’s something indelible about Spider-Man.</p>
<p>At the time, Slott wasn’t much of a comics collector. But as a fan of the 1967 animated series and its ubiquitous theme song (“Spider-Man, Spider-Man / does whatever a spider can”), he couldn’t pass up the opportunity. Slott begged his dad for an allowance so he could buy comics for Spider-Man to sign. By the time he came across the man in the Spider-Man suit, the experience had changed him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a founder, product lead at Pinterest and PM for a couple products at Google, as well as a growth partner for Initialized Capital, I’ve seen many product teams struggle to grow. Many products start out with a bang. Some find product-market fit with sustained growth. A few have gone through spurts of hyper-growth. But more often than not, I’ve seen most of them linger then fizzle.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Founders launch their product, wonder why it isn’t growing like gangbusters and then immediately try to fix their growth problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>They turn to growth tactics like optimizing their on-boarding funnel, SEO or push notifications before really understanding what they are building and who they are building for. This may create an initial burst of short-term growth.</p>
<p>But it ultimately leads to high churn of your possible customers, while ignoring problems in the core product.<br />
Before trying different growth tactics like throwing spaghetti at a wall, startups need to take a fresh look at their users, evaluate their product end goals and re-define the journey they want their users to take to get there. Here are some tips that can help define a path which will clarify the different steps needed to unlock product growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As designers, we are constantly experimenting with tools and processes in an attempt to find the one that works best. After a great deal of experimentation, I’ve discovered the perfect design workflow, and I’m going to share it with you now. Design is a process and the process I’m going to share is the one I’ve used on all my projects to build habit-forming products that people love.Sketching (paper and pen) — every great design begins on paper. Get out that paper and pen and start drawing some shapes.Your next step is to take photos of your sketches on your smart phone and throw those babies into POP so you can test your prototype.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your next step is to make wireframes. Having sketches is never enough.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Wireframes are a must 100% of the time. There is simply no way around it. Go ahead and open Omnigraffle and make your wires. Now realize you need a dropdown menu so re-do those wires in Balsamiq. Good when designing for 3rd graders. Next, realize you f***ing hate Balsamiq and redo them in Axure.Next, realize you f***ing hate Axure so switch over to Adobe Illustrator and use that UI Wireframing kit you bought for $89.</p>
<p>Now export those wires to PNGs and import them into Invision so you can share them with your team.Wake up the next morning and cry into your bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats because of all the mean comments that Jonathan left on your Invision prototype. This shit’s delicious. Agree to never use Invision again ever. Because f**k Jonathan.Redo your prototype in Marvel and hope that Jonathan can’t figure out how to leave comments on Marvel.You succeeded.</p>
<p>Wireframes are finally approved. No thanks to Jonathan. Time to start working on a higher fidelity prototype.Grab the same stock photos that everyone else uses and then use Photoshop to optimize them. Looks pretty optimized.Now, open up Sketch and start creating the UI for your app. It’s starting to look like a real product now! Now export these as PNGs and import screens into Flinto Lite.</p>
